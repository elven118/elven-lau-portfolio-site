    Hi, I'm Elven. I have a diverse technical skill set that includes backend programming languages such as Python,
    Java, C#.NET, and NodeJS, as well as web app development with ReactJS and AngularJS.
    <br />
    <br />
    Over the past three years, I have gained valuable experience working for companies that provide web application
    solutions to their clients. In my previous roles, I was responsible for the entire project life-cycle, from
    gathering client requirements to designing, coding, testing, and documenting the app. This experience has given me a
    well-rounded understanding of the development process and has prepared me for the challenges of working in a
    fast-paced and dynamic environment.
    <br />
    <br />
    As a developer, I am passionate about using technology to benefit the world. I am constantly seeking opportunities
    to build innovative, fancy, and fun applications that solve real-world problems. Additionally, I am always eager to
    learn about new technologies and methodologies that can enhance my skills and enable me to build better
    applications.
